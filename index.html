                    <div class="subsubtitle">Seong-Jin Cho’s latest album for Deutsche Grammophon revels in the expressive freedom and emotional richness of Mozart’s Piano Concerto in D minor and other lyrical works for solo keyboard</div>
                    <div class="text-area"><span>Piano concertos, designed to please a paying audience, were part of Mozart’s daily business. Yet he lifted the genre high above anything that had gone before, so high that he effectively invented it in the form we know today. His mature piano concertos – famously difficult to bring to life in performance – stand among the supreme tests of a performer’s powers. Seong-Jin Cho has chosen one of the most demanding of the composer’s works for keyboard and orchestra, the Piano Concerto in D minor K466, to launch his first Mozart recording for Deutsche Grammophon. The Korean pianist’s latest album, which also includes the dramatic Piano Sonata in F major K332, the early Piano Sonata in B flat major K281, and the Fantasia in D minor K397, bears witness to a musical love affair that began in childhood and has deepened since he won the International Chopin Competition in Warsaw three years ago.</span><div class="read-more"><a href="https://www.deutschegrammophon.com/en/cat/4835522">Read More...</a></div></div>

                    <div class="text-area"><span>Long queues formed outside record stores throughout Asia when Deutsche Grammophon rush-released its recording of live highlights from Seong-Jin Cho’s performances at the 2015 International Chopin Piano Competition. The South Korean pianist stormed the album charts in countries across the region last November, securing his status among classical music’s brightest rising stars and attracting worldwide critical acclaim. His first studio recording for the yellow label, set for international release on Friday 25 November, presents the compelling coupling of Chopin’s Piano Concerto No.1 in E minor and the same composer’s Four Ballades, works at the heart of the 22-year-old artist’s repertoire. “This really is dream repertoire for me,” notes Cho, who fell in love with the Ballades as a child after hearing Krystian Zimerman’s recording of the works for Deutsche Grammophon.</span><div class="read-more"><a href="https://www.deutschegrammophon.com/en/cat/4798336?">Read More...</a></div></div>
